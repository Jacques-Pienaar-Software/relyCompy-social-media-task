Good day Joe,

I hope that this mail finds you well!

I am contacting you to gain some further insights into the transactions 
being made at [CompanyName]. Please review the list of questions that I have
below and kindly get back to me.

1. How does the information about transactions get used at the moment 
(i.e. Do you have processes that take effect the moment a transaction 
is completed or do you process transactions in bulk on a daily basis)?

2. How many different types or categories of transactions do you do on a 
daily/monthly basis, and would you be able to share some blueprints or schemas with us?

3. Would you be able to provide metrics of the number of transactions done and the sizes of 
these transactions for the past 6 months. This is so that we can effectively budget resources 
and ensure a reliable system?

Please advise on the questions above, and let me know if 
you have any questions. 

Kind regards,

Jacques Pienaar
